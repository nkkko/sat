Sat is a WebAssembly-powered server designed to have the maximum performance and smallest possible footprint. Sat has a simple purpose: run a single Wasm module really f***ing fast.

Sat has no dependencies (it's statically compiled), and can run in a tiny Docker container (Distroless) or on bare metal. It's meant to live in small places such as edge compute environments.
